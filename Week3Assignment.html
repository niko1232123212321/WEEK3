    <h1>Experiment Description</h1>
    <p>College students consume surprising quantities of <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> on average. 
        This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">grade point average</a> in school.</p>
    <h1>Steps to Reproduce</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            100 Students were selected from volunteer applicant between the ages of 18-22 years old, 
            with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each student was assigned a number from 1-100.
        </li>
        <li>
            Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C.
        </li>
        <li>
            Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average).
        </li>
        <li>
            Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day.
        </li>
        <li>
            Group C was given a placebo.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted.
        </li>
    </ol>
